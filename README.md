# Popfit

## Goal For This Project

Welcome from Popfit! This class based gym is the perfect setting to sweat and have fun in East London. On the site you will find relevant information you need as a visitor in an easily navigatable design. 

A intuitive user experience is important which is why users will find all the information they are looking for in a clear way. 

## Table of Contents
 
## UX

An important aspect of the planning for this project were the elements of User-Experience. Planning the project through this approach created a useful guide to understand the user's needs and streamline the development of the site. My personal goal was to create a positive user experience. 

## User Goals

- Website with important information
- Contact info about the gym
- Form to submit your info
- A website that caters to desktop, tablet & mobile
- Visual elements that catch your eye 
- See schedule of classes & descriptions

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to easily find contact information of the gym.
- As a user, I want to find information of prices for gym services.
- As a user, I want to become a member online. 
- As a user, I want to see when there are classes to see if it fits my schedule. 
- As a user, it is important that I can navigate the website and find what I'm looking for. 
- As a user, I want there to be social media links that open in separate tabs. 
- As a user, I want the website to be intuitive to increase the chance of my booking classes. 
- As a user, I want to know more about the gym procedures.
- As a user, forms should be easy to fill and submit. 

## Site Owners Goals
- As the site owner, I want to attract new members.
- As the site owner, I want to differenciate my self from other gyms.

- As the site owner, I want to increase video traffic.

### wireframes
- [Wireframes](https://github.com/keeks-mtl/keeks-mtl.github.io/blob/main/assets/wireframes/popfit-wireframe.pdf): A 5 page website.

The initial wireframes and the current project differ in some minor ways: 
- The desktop version navbar has different/clearer terms to illustrate what you can find on the pages.
- The desktop version main page information is centered for a better aesthetic.
- The desktop version footer is all on one line. 
- The mobile version has just the logo on the navbar.
- The mobile version has the FAQ on the footer.

### Design Choices
- The gym is marketed towards women, so I made my design choices to cater that segmentation decision. 
- I attempted to create a website that felt free & fun and not too rigid. 
- The colour choices where centered around [colorspace](https://mycolor.space/) to find the complementary colour palettes that worked well.

### Fonts 
- The goal was an overall cohesive feeling to the website so I decided not to use multiple fonts.
- I wanted something that was contemporary but also familiar so I chose a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) that was popular and familiar. 

### Icons
- The site doesn't include too many icons to create a familiar look and is clear for the user. 
- Users are very familiar with the social media icons and the main navigational icons so those where the only ones I used because they allowed less text to be written. 
- The icons made the the content more conscise and didnt' distract from the information. 
- The icon seen most is the hamburger icon that will make navigation more simple on mobile devices. 

### Colours
- The colour theme included four main colours that went together.
- #f1a293
- #7c7c7d
- #f8f9f
- #30c1cf  
- The colours were chosen because of their contrast and the way they link to the branding of the gym. 

## Features

- Responsive on all device sizes
- Interactive elements
 
### Navigation

- The navigation bar was created using Bootstrap to ensure that it was fully responsive such as including a hamburger menu when viewed on smaller viewports. The navbar is fixed to the top so that users navigating the site can always have easy access to all sections of the site. 

## Jumbotron
- The main page has a jumbotron to allow user's to get a feel for the gym that is 100% width and is fully responsive.  

### Cards
- The cards include the main information that users are looking for. They are clear with crisp imagery and include information & links to the relevant sections. 

### Pricing
- Clear information about pricing and the ability for user's to choose an option with they'd like to purchase on the spot. 

### Schedule
- Information for users that is clear and easy to read. Incredibly important that it is responsive on all devices. 

### Signup
- Ability for users to give information in a clearly structured form with validations so that information isn't incomplete. 

### Features Left to Implement
- Because of covid, the actual gym location is no longer available online so once that information is available it would be included on the site, as well as, an interactive map for the location.  
- Once javascript and the backend part of the site is linked then the ability actually send the form details will be added with password validations. 
password validation
- It was important to show that there would be direct payment abilities on the site however a fully linked direct payment system is not included at this moment. 
- The class booking will eventually be linked to a database with class availabilities. 
- There will also eventually include direct links and login to videos.

### Navigation bar
1. Plan
    * Make sure it's fixed at top so that it is always easily found
    * On every page every link should take you to where you are supposed to go 
    * On mobile devices the navbar should turn to hamburger so it's visible and drop-down menu should appear so sections can be chosen

2. Implementation
    * The navbar was created using Bootstrap so that it was fully responsive
    * In the mobile implementation the Popfit header is hidden as a link

3. Test
    * Clicked on every link on every page & checked everypage on different breakpoints to ensure responsiveness

4. Verdict
    * Passed all the tests after so changes (mostly on much smaller mobile devices)

### Modals
1. Plan
    * Wanted a modal to pop up to choose a buying option for quick decision making to convert sales
    * For the modal to be clearly laid out

2. Implementation
    * Bootstrap was to create the modal however, it is currently missing the necessary javascript
    * Used colours that went with website so that it carried the branding theme and didn't feel seperate 
    * Overwrote Bootstrap CSS to go with website

3.  Test
    * Tested modal on different devices & different browsers
    * Made sure buttons work (both submit and close)
    * Made sure link worked
    * Make sure all required fields are validated before it can be submitted

4. Verdict
    * The modal opened up when right button clicked
    * The formatting worked across multiple devices

### Contact form

1. Plan
    * Include contact form that is clearly & logically laid out
    * Required information are clearly marked and show when empty when trying to submit

2. Implementation
    * Created signup.html
    * Used Bootstrap for responsiveness and validation
    * Form styled in accordance with website branding

    * Tested form with validator and saw that label & input didn't correlate
    * Made sure all required fields were filled in and gave clear indicators when empty
    * Fixed problem with radio coding so they worked correctly
    * Added placeholders for Date of birth section because one main visible label
    * Had to research how to make it accesible because of labelling decision

#### Fix

## Deployment

This project has been deployed using GitHub pages and I have used the following process to do so:

**Publishing**

* Opened Github pages. 
* Opened Github desktop and created a repository using only my member name. 
* Go to Visual Studio Code and connect Visual Studio Code to my Github account.
* Stage pages on Visual Studio Code.
* Commit pages on Visual Studio code & push them. 
* Once that is finished go to link on Github pages that includes your Github username. 
* Click on the Github Pages web address and you will see your project live.
* There was an issue with cloning the initial Github repository to the live Github page so the original git commits on seen on the original [Github Respository](https://github.com/keeks-mtl/milestone-project-Popfit)

**Forking**
You can fork a project to make a copy without it affecting the main branch with this process:

* log in to GitHub and find the repository that you wish to fork
* Once you have clicked on the repository, on the top right-hand side you will see three options: 'unwatch' 'star' and 'fork'
* Once the fork button is clicked, you will then have a copy of the repository in your Github account

**Cloning**
You can clone/download your chosen repository to your local device by using this process:

* Choose the Github repository that you wish to clone.
* Chose the 'code' button at the top next top 'add file'.
* Copy the link that you are given.
* Open your terminal and choose the directory to the location you would like the clone to be in.
* type in *git clone* and paste the URL you copied and then click enter.
