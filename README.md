## UX

An important aspect of the planning for this project was the element of User-Experience. Directing the planning of the project through a User-Experience approach created a useful guide to understand the user's needs and streamline the development of the site. Through visiting Popfit, it was important to create a positive user experience.

### User Goals

- Website with important information
- Contact info about the gym
- Form to submit your info
- A website that caters to desktop, tablet & mobile
- Visual elements that catch your eye
- Ability to see the schedule of classes & descriptions

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to easily find the contact information of the gym.
- As a user, I want to find information on prices for gym services.
- As a user, I want to become a member online.
- As a user, I want to see when there are classes to see if it fits my schedule.
- As a user, it is important that I can navigate the website and find what I'm looking for.
- As a user, I want there to be social media links that open in separate tabs.
- As a user, I want the website to be intuitive to increase the chance of my booking classes.
- As a user, I want to know more about gym procedures.
- As a user, forms should be easy to fill and submit.

### Site Owners Goals

- As the site owner, I want to attract new members.
- As the site owner, I want to differentiate myself from other gyms.
- As the site owner, I want to increase class bookings.
- As the site owner, I want to increase video traffic.

### wireframes

- [Wireframes](https://github.com/keeks-mtl/keeks-mtl.github.io/blob/main/assets/wireframes/popfit-wireframe.pdf): A 6 page website.

The initial wireframes and the current project differ in some minor ways:

- The desktop version navbar has different/clearer terms to illustrate what you can find on the pages.
- The desktop version main page information is centered for a better aesthetic.
- The desktop version footer is all on one line.
- The mobile version has just the logo on the navbar.
- The mobile version has the FAQ on the footer.

### Design Choices

- The gym is marketed towards women, so I made my design choices to cater to that segmentation decision.
- I attempted to create a website that felt light, fun and not too rigid.
- The colour choices were centered around [colorspace](https://mycolor.space/) to find the complementary colour palettes that worked well.

### Fonts

- The goal was an overall cohesive feeling to the website so I decided not to use multiple fonts, choosing the font 'Roboto'.
- I wanted something contemporary but also clean & clear. The font was chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to make sure it worked across browsers/devices.

### Icons

- The site doesn't include too many icons to create a user-friendly experience and is familiar to the user.
- Users are very familiar with the social media icons and the main navigational icons, which is why those were the only ones used.
- The icons made the content more concise and didn't distract from the information.
- The icon seen most is the hamburger icon that will make navigation more simple on mobile devices.

### Colours

![popfit-colours](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66472161/116217775-d436b500-a741-11eb-80e8-a58ecb830cb7.PNG)

- The colour theme included four main colours that complimented one another.
- #f1a293
- #7c7c7d
- #f8f9f
- #30c1cf
- The colours were chosen because of their contrast and the way they link to the branding of the gym.

## Features

- Responsive on all device sizes
  - Including a change in layout across different breakpoints.
- Interactive elements
  - Including: buttons, links, dropdown menus, and forms.

### Navigation

- The navigation bar was created using Bootstrap to ensure that it was fully responsive.
- An example of the change with responsiveness includes a hamburger menu when viewed on smaller viewports.

### Jumbotron

- The main page has a jumbotron to allow users to get a feel for the gym that is 100% the width and is fully responsive.

### Cards

- There are multiple cards across the site to include snapshots of information that users require.
- They are clear with crisp imagery and include information & links to the relevant sections.

### Pricing

- Clear information about pricing and the ability for users to choose an option they'd like to purchase on the spot.

### Schedule

- Information for users that is clear and easy to read. Important that the depth of information is responsive on all devices.

### Signup

- Ability for users to give information in a structured form with validations so that information isn't incomplete.

### Features Left to Implement

- Because of Covid, the actual gym location is no longer available online. Once that information is available it would be included on the site with an interactive map for the location.
- Once javascript and the backend section of the site are linked, then the ability to send the form details will be added, including password validations.
- It was important to show that there would be direct payment abilities on the site, however, a fully linked direct payment system is not included at this moment.
- The class booking section of the site will eventually be linked to a database with class availabilities.
- There will also eventually include direct links and log in to videos.

- **Further Testing**
    - The site was further tested for responsiveness through Chrome devtools across multiple device sizes including multiple for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. 
    - Friends were asked to test on personal devices and requested to look for any flaws or issues.
    - There was also tested done across multiple browsers to look for issues. 

### Navigation bar

![popfit-navbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66472161/116215932-05ae8100-a740-11eb-80b4-3b943ddd48b0.PNG)

1. Plan

   - On every page, every link should take you to where you are supposed to go
   - On mobile devices the navbar should turn to hamburger so it's visible and the drop-down menu should appear so navigational elements can be chosen

2. Implementation

   - The navbar was created using Bootstrap so that it was fully responsive
   - In the mobile implementation the Popfit header is hidden as a link

3. Test

   - Clicked on every link on every page & checked every page on different breakpoints to ensure responsiveness

4. Verdict
   - Passed all the tests after some changes (mostly on much smaller mobile devices)

### Modals

![popfit-buynowmodal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66472161/116216221-4dcda380-a740-11eb-8ca7-e7f1c3fd6905.PNG)

1. Plan

   - Wanted a modal to pop up to choose a buying option for quick decision making to convert sales
   - For the modal to be organised in a clear fashion

2. Implementation

   - Bootstrap was used to create the modal however, it is currently missing the necessary javascript
   - Used colours that went with the website so that it carried the branding theme and didn't feel separate
   - Overwrote Bootstrap CSS so modal carried the same branding as website

3. Test

   - Tested modal on different devices & different browsers
   - Made sure buttons work (both submit and close)
   - Made sure link worked
   - Make sure all required fields are validated before they can be submitted

4. Verdict
   - The modal opened up when the right button clicked
   - The formatting worked across multiple devices

### Contact form

![popfit-signup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66472161/116216297-62aa3700-a740-11eb-90d3-c345b0c5ac69.PNG)

1. Plan

   - Include contact form that is clear & logically laid out
   - Required information is explicitly marked and show when empty when trying to submit

2. Implementation

   - Created signup.html
   - Used Bootstrap for responsiveness and validation
   - Form styled following the website branding

3. Test

   - Tested form with validator and saw that label & input didn't correlate
   - Made sure all required fields were filled in and gave clear indicators when empty
   - Fixed problem with radio coding so they worked correctly
   - Added placeholders for the date of birth section because one main visible label on three input sections
   - Had to research how to make it accessible because of labeling decision
   - Info not sent because has not been covered in course yet

4. Verdict
   - Form worked and looked the way i wanted across all devices
   - Isn't sent correctly yet because hasn't been covered in the course

## Bugs

### Buy Now Modal Button

#### Bug

- After clicking the Buy Now button to open the modal if you close the modal without submitting it the button turns grey and doesn't change back to original pink colour.

#### Fix

- Found what CSS styling was creating the issue and added the Bootstrap class no-shadow.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed using GitHub pages and I have used the following process to do so:

### Publishing

- Opened Github pages.
- Opened Github desktop and created a repository using only my member name.
- Go to Visual Studio Code and connect Visual Studio Code to my Github account.
- Stage pages on Visual Studio Code.
- Commit pages on Visual Studio code & push them.
- Once that is finished go to link on Github pages that includes your Github username.
- Click on the Github Pages web address and you will see your project live.
- There was an issue with cloning the initial Github repository to the live Github page so the original git commits on seen on the original [Github Respository](https://github.com/keeks-mtl/milestone-project-Popfit)

### Forking

You can fork a project to make a copy without it affecting the main branch with this process:

- Log in to GitHub and find the repository that you wish to fork
- Clicked on the repository and on the top right-hand side you will see three options: 'unwatch' 'star' and 'fork'
- Once the fork button has been clicked, a copy of the repository will be in your Github account

### Cloning

You can clone the repository to your local device following these steps:

- Choose the Github repository that you'd like
- Click the 'code' button at the top right next to 'add file'
- Copy the link that pops up
- Open your terminal and choose the directory you would like the clone to be in
- Type 'git clone' and paste the URL you copied afterwards and then click enter

### Version Control

- Because of an issue with the original Github repository the original version controls are in a different repository than the final version of Popfit. The initial commits and update to the project are on the original [Github Respository](https://github.com/keeks-mtl/milestone-project-Popfit) and the later versions are on this repository.
